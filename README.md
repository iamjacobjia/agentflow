# AgentFlow

AgentFlow is a Python orchestrator for `codex`, `claude`, and `kimi` agents with Airflow-style DAGs, parallel scheduling, multiple execution targets, and a live web console for traces and artifacts.

## Features

- Airflow-like pipeline definitions in Python and YAML
- Parallel DAG execution with dependency-aware scheduling
- Per-node selection of model, provider, tools policy, MCP servers, and skills
- Execution targets for local processes, containers, and AWS Lambda
- Per-node output capture as either final response or full trace
- Post-run success criteria including output contains text, file exists, file contains text, and file non-empty
- Run queueing, retries, retry backoff, cancellation, rerun, and persisted run recovery
- Web UI for DAG state, attempt history, JSONL trace parsing, stdout/stderr, and node artifacts
- API endpoints for validation, launch, events, artifacts, cancel, rerun, and health checks

## Why this shape

This project was built in this repo, and the integrations were informed by:

- OpenAI Codex CLI patterns in `reference/codex`
- Claude Code web and stream patterns in `reference/claude-code-telegram`
- Moonshot Kimi CLI protocol and UI patterns in `reference/kimi-cli`

Those references shaped the trace parsers, adapter contracts, and frontend event model.

## Install

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Quick start

Validate a pipeline:

```bash
agentflow validate examples/pipeline.yaml
```

Run a pipeline once:

```bash
agentflow run examples/pipeline.yaml
```

Run the web console:

```bash
agentflow serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Runtime configuration

You can configure the runtime via CLI flags or environment variables.

- `AGENTFLOW_RUNS_DIR`: base directory for run state and artifacts
- `AGENTFLOW_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`: maximum number of concurrently executing DAG runs

CLI equivalents:

```bash
agentflow serve --runs-dir .agentflow/runs --max-concurrent-runs 2
agentflow run examples/pipeline.yaml --runs-dir .agentflow/runs --max-concurrent-runs 2
```

## Airflow-like Python DAG

```python
from agentflow import DAG, claude, codex, kimi

with DAG("demo", working_dir=".", concurrency=3) as dag:
    plan = codex(task_id="plan", prompt="Inspect the repo and plan the work.")
    implement = claude(
        task_id="implement",
        prompt="Implement the plan:\n\n{{ nodes.plan.output }}",
        tools="read_write",
    )
    review = kimi(
        task_id="review",
        prompt="Review the plan:\n\n{{ nodes.plan.output }}",
        capture="trace",
    )
    merge = codex(
        task_id="merge",
        prompt="Merge the implementation and review outputs.",
    )

    plan >> [implement, review]
    [implement, review] >> merge

spec = dag.to_spec()
```

See `examples/airflow_like.py` for a complete runnable example.

## Pipeline schema

Each node supports:

- `agent`: `codex`, `claude`, or `kimi`
- `model`: any model string understood by the backend
- `provider`: a string or a structured provider config with `base_url`, `api_key_env`, headers, and env
- `tools`: `read_only` or `read_write`
- `mcps`: a list of MCP server definitions
- `skills`: a list of local skill paths or names
- `target`: `local`, `container`, or `aws_lambda`
- `capture`: `final` or `trace`
- `retries` and `retry_backoff_seconds`
- `success_criteria`: output or filesystem checks evaluated after execution

Top-level pipeline controls include:

- `concurrency`: max parallel nodes within a run
- `fail_fast`: skip downstream work after the first failed node

Built-in provider shorthands:

- `codex`: `openai`
- `claude`: `anthropic`, `kimi`
- `kimi`: `kimi`, `moonshot`, `moonshot-ai`

`provider: kimi` is intentionally rejected on `codex` nodes. Codex requires an OpenAI Responses API backend, and Kimi's public endpoints do not expose `/responses`.

## Execution targets

### Local

Runs the prepared agent command directly on the host. Set `target.shell` to wrap the command in a specific shell, such as `bash -lc`. You can also use a `{command}` placeholder in the shell string to run shell bootstrap steps before the prepared agent command.

### Container

Wraps the command in `docker run`, mounts the working directory, runtime directory, and the AgentFlow app, then streams stdout and stderr back into the run trace.

### AWS Lambda

Invokes `agentflow.remote.lambda_handler.handler`. The payload contains the prepared command, environment, runtime files, and execution metadata so the Lambda package can execute the node remotely.

## Agent notes

### Codex

- Uses `codex exec --json`
- Maps tools mode to Codex sandboxing
- Writes `CODEX_HOME/config.toml` per node for provider and MCP selection

### Claude

- Uses `claude -p ... --output-format stream-json --verbose`
- Passes `--allowedTools` according to the read-only vs read-write policy
- Writes a per-node MCP JSON config and passes it with `--mcp-config`

### Kimi

- Uses `python3 -m agentflow.remote.kimi_bridge`
- Emits a Kimi-style JSON-RPC event stream
- Calls Moonshot's OpenAI-compatible chat completions API
- Provides a small built-in tool layer for read, search, write, and shell actions

## Web console

The frontend shows:

- current DAG state and node statuses
- live run timeline and parsed JSONL trace events
- per-node attempts and retry history
- final outputs plus stdout, stderr, trace, and result artifacts
- controls to validate, launch, cancel, and rerun pipelines

Artifact files are persisted under `AGENTFLOW_RUNS_DIR/<run_id>/artifacts/<node_id>/`.

## API surface

The FastAPI app exposes:

- `POST /api/runs/validate`
- `POST /api/runs`
- `GET /api/runs`
- `GET /api/runs/{run_id}`
- `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/events`
- `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/stream`
- `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/artifacts/{node_id}/{name}`
- `POST /api/runs/{run_id}/cancel`
- `POST /api/runs/{run_id}/rerun`
- `GET /api/health`

## Testing

Run the Python suite:

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
pytest -q
```

Run the browser suite:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright test
```

The Playwright tests use lightweight mock `codex` and `claude` executables under `tests/e2e/bin/` and exercise validation, retries, rerun, cancellation, and artifact viewing through the web UI.

Run a real local smoke check with your installed CLIs:

```bash
bash -lic 'kimi; . .venv/bin/activate; agentflow run examples/local-real-agents-kimi-smoke.yaml'
```

This keeps the check small while exercising both local `codex` and local `claude` end-to-end. If your shell defines the `kimi` helper in `~/.bashrc`, the interactive login shell above will load it before running AgentFlow.
